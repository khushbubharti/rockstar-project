# Rockstar Pandas Project

This repository contains the material (notebooks, data) for Rockstar Pandas Project. This project is a part of acadmic coursework for PG Diploma in Data Science & Analytics at CCSD, J.C. Bose University of Science & Technology, Faridabad, India.

## Requirements to run this Project

You need to havr the following dependencies installed:

- Python version 3.x 
- pandas
- numpy 
- matplotlib
- seaborn

I recommend to use the [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html) environment manager to install all the requirements 
(you can install [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) or install the (very large) Anaconda software
distribution, found at http://continuum.io/downloads).

Once this is installed, the following command will install all required packages in your Python environment:
```
conda install pandas jupyter seaborn
```
